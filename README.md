# Code
Software made with my own hands. It rocks, don't you think so? ;-)

Note: X-TRACT works fine on MSDOS. It was compiled with TASM 2.0

Fun fact: As you can see, filenames were created with uppercase letters, but sources includes those files with lowercase! (yes, it compiles fine. MSDOS / Windows ignores case)
