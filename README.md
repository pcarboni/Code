## X-TRACT - MSDOS executable file unpacker

### What to find here? In this repo you will find X-TRACT sources/binaries/keymakers/tutorial

Original quotes:

* My original quote (1994/95): "X-TRACT - The next generation of Unprotectors" :-)
* From [SAC](https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=X): "X-TRACT v1.51 - EXE files unpacker by Pablo Carboni - Original ASM x86 sources now included" (1996, now updated on Oct'2018)

Yes, the original mirror was/is [Slovakian Antivirus Center](https://www.sac.sk). Thanks to Peter Hubinsky - [SAC Site adm](ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk) - for his kindly and great support with the file uploading, since 1996 until today! - (Oct/2018)

> Note: X-TRACT works fine on MSDOS. It was compiled with TASM 2.0

*Fun fact:* As you can see, filenames were created with uppercase letters [8 letters max + 3 letters ext], but sources includes those files with lowercase! (yes, it compiles fine. MSDOS / Windows ignores case)

### Disclaimer:

- Files under "ASM_x86-SRC" and "MSDOS-BIN" directory name are released with BSD license, with source open for educational purposes, (after 23 years)
- Files under "KEYMAKERS" directory name are keymakers found on the internet!
- File under "TUTORIAL" directory name is an ASM tutorial made with X-TRACT as use case!

### Personal disclaimer:

- X-TRACT intention was to avoid "scrambled binaries", with viruses/trojan horses inside.
- It was my first home-made ASM program. I know, it sucks, as the English language contained inside. ;-)
- Please, accept my apologizes if you found any offending comment. Hope you understand. I was a young boy, with 18 years old at that time :-P.
