# Code
Software made with my own hands. It rocks, don't you think so? ;-)

(Currently available X-TRACT unpacker)

Original quote: "X-TRACT - The next generation of Unprotectors"

Note: X-TRACT works fine on MSDOS. It was compiled with TASM 2.0

Fun fact: As you can see, filenames were created with uppercase letters [8 letters max + 3 letters ext], but sources includes those files with lowercase! (yes, it compiles fine. MSDOS / Windows ignores case)

Disclaimer:

- Files under "ASM_x86-SRC" and "MSDOS-BIN" directory name are released with BSD license, with source open for educational purposes, (after 23 years)
- Files under "KEYMAKERS" directory name are keymakers found on the internet!
- File under "TUTORIAL" directory name is an ASM tutorial made with X-TRACT as use case!

Personal disclaimers:

- X-TRACT intention was to avoid "scrambled binaries", with viruses/trojan horses inside.
- It was my first home-made ASM program. I know, it sucks, as the English language contained inside. ;-)
- Please, accept my apologizes if you found any offending comment. Hope you understand. I was a young boy, with 18 years old at that time :-P.
